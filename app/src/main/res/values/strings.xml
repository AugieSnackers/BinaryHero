    <string name="tutorial_content">In binary you only count with 0's and 1's!
        We start at 0, and then next is 1 however there is no 2.  Instead we
        now count to 10.  The far right number stands for 1, the number to the
        left of that stands for 2, then 4, then 8, 16, 32 and so on.  So counting to 6
        would look like 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110.  5 is 101 because the left most 1
        represents a 4, the 2's place is empty, and then the ones place has a 1 so
        you add 1 + 4 to get 5.  With 6 the 4's place and the 2's place are both occupied
        by 1's so we add 4 + 2 = 6.  </string>
