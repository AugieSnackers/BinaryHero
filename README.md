Binary Hero is an educational game that teaches students how to count in binary.  Balls with numbers in them fall down the screen 
and text is apparent asking you to find a number.  To win you must click on the ball before time is up or before the ball makes 
too many trips down the screen.  If the ball is on it's last trip it will turn red to warn you time is almost up.  Once you have
found all of the answers asked for that level a password appears to grant you access to the next level if you decide to play 
at another time.  As the levels go up the game gets harder; the balls move faster, and you have to find larger numbers.  

Binary Hero works when a player hits start by checking what the toggle button is switched to (2 or 10).  It then checks if someone 
entered a password, and if they did if that password matches any passwords in the array list of passwords, if it does then a new 
game is called with the corresponding password level.  If no password is entered then a new game is started at level 0.
